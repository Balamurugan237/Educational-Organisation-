# Educational-Organisation- The project “Educational Organisation Using ServiceNow” focuses on developing a digital management system for educational institutions by utilizing the ServiceNow cloud platform. The main goal is to automate and simplify everyday academic and administrative processes such as student management, faculty coordination, and course tracking — all within a single, centralized system.

Traditionally, educational institutions rely on manual processes for handling student records, staff requests, and academic operations. These methods are often time-consuming, error-prone, and lack data transparency. To overcome these challenges, this project uses ServiceNow, a powerful workflow automation platform, to create custom tables, forms, and workflows that digitize and automate these operations.

The system allows administrators to manage student registrations, faculty details, course information, and departmental activities efficiently. Automated workflows ensure that approvals and updates occur in real time, reducing delays and manual intervention. Additionally, reports and dashboards are integrated to monitor institutional performance, such as attendance, academic progress, and workload distribution.

By leveraging Business Rules, Flow Designer, and Performance Analytics within ServiceNow, the project ensures that all data is accurate, up-to-date, and accessible from anywhere. The system enhances transparency, saves time, and improves communication between departments, faculty, and students.

In conclusion, “Educational Organisation Using ServiceNow” demonstrates how ServiceNow can be extended beyond IT services to serve the education domain, offering a smart, automated, and scalable platform that modernizes institutional management and supports the vision of a digital campus.
